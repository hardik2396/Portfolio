# Video Colorization
MICROSOFT AI & RESEARCH, USA, Senior Data Scientist Anirudh Koul.
* Proposed a spatio temporal end to end module that effectively exploits temporal redundancies while
  maintaining real-time speed for video colorization task.
* Spatial Transformer Network was used to encode optical flow features for motion estimation and motion
   compensation to reduce flickering noise in the output.
* Early fusion, slow fusion and 3D convolutions were explored for the joint processing of multiple
consecutive video frames.
